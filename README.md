# Vinylo

**Your Personal Music Ranker**

Vinylo helps you discover your true music preferences by pitting your favorite albums against each other. Using your listening history from Last.fm or Spotify, it creates 1v1 matchups where you decide the winner. Over time, this builds a highly accurate, personalized ranking of your music library.

## Features

-   **Connect Your Music**: Seamlessly integrates with your Last.fm or Spotify account to fetch your top albums.
-   **1v1 Battles**: Simple "this or that" choices make ranking fun and easy.
-   **Smart Ranking**: Uses an advanced ELO rating system (like in chess) to calculate scores based on your decisions.
-   **Clean Up**: Automatically filters out singles and albums you rarely listen to, so you focus on what matters.
-   **Leaderboard**: Watch your favorite albums climb the ranks on your personal scoreboard.

## How to Use

### 1. Get Started
When you first launch Vinylo, you'll be asked to connect your music account.
-   **Last.fm Users**: Enter your username to fetch your top albums.

### 2. Start Ranking
Once your albums are loaded, the fun begins! You'll see two albums side-by-side.
-   Click on the album you prefer.
-   The winner gains points, and the loser loses points.
-   A new matchup will appear instantly.

### 3. View Your Stats
Curious about your top 10?
-   Click the **Leaderboard** button in the main menu.
-   See your albums ranked from #1 to #50 based on your matchup decisions.

### 4. Settings & Reset
-   **Ignore Albums**: If an album appears that you don't want to rank (like a comedy album or a soundtrack), you can "Ignore" it, and it won't show up in matchups again.
-   **Reset**: Want to start over? You can reset your rankings in the Settings menu.
